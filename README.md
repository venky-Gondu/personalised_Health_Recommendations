# Personalized Lifestyle Recommendation

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Personalized Lifestyle Recommendation System** is an AI-driven application that provides tailored lifestyle recommendations based on a user's age and gender, inferred from facial images. This project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately estimate age and gender, then uses this information to offer personalized suggestions across multiple lifestyle categories, such as diet, fitness, books, and music.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Facial Analysis:** Uses deep learning to predict age and gender from facial images.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Generates recommendations for food, exercise, books, and music based on the user's age group.
- **Multi-Task Learning Approach:** Simultaneously optimizes both age and gender predictions using a modified VGG16 architecture.
- **Efficient Prediction Pipeline:** Ensures real-time or near-real-time responses.

## 🏗️ Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Preparation:**
   - Used the **UTKFace dataset**, which contains over 20,000 facial images annotated with age, gender, and ethnicity.
   - Preprocessed images (resizing, normalization) to enhance model performance.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Implemented a **modified VGG16 architecture** for multi-task learning.
   - Utilized a **combined loss function** to optimize both age and gender predictions.
   - Applied **transfer learning** to improve accuracy.

3. **Training & Validation:**
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets.
   - Used **Adam optimizer** and **categorical cross-entropy loss** for training.
   - Implemented **data augmentation** to improve generalization.

4. **Recommendation System:**
   - Mapped predicted age groups to suitable lifestyle recommendations.
   - Categories include **food choices, fitness routines, book genres, and music preferences**.

5. **Deployment & UI:**
   - Built an interactive UI using **Streamlit**.
   - Integrated the deep learning model with the UI for seamless user experience.
